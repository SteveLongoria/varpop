    <h1 style="margin-bottom:30px;" class="text-center">Your Business Has A Poor Google Rating & Itâ€™s Costing You Serious Money</h1>
    <p>You're tired of the <em>constant struggle</em> and need to acquire positive Google and Yelp reviews. It's so difficult to get positive reviews from happy customers, you feel like you have to <em>twist their arm</em> just to tell the internet how much they love your business.</p>
<p>On the flip side, if you make one slip-up or you're not able to please one customer, they're whipping out their phone to leave a nasty review <em><u>before they even walk out the door</u></em>!</p>
<h1 style="margin-bottom:40px;margin-top:40px;" class="text-center">You Can&rsquo;t Continue Doing Business Like This</h1>
<p>I'm not here to throw this in your face or criticize. I understand that even the best businesses get negative reviews, <em>it's just how it works</em>. <strong><u>No business can please everybody.</u></strong></p>
<p>Nevertheless, anything less than a 4 star Google Review is costing your business massive amounts of money in lost customers.</p>
<p>According to the latest surveys <em>6 in 10 customers</em> are looking at your Google Reviews first before deciding to do business with you. <strong>80% of consumers</strong> say the star ratings they trust the most are 4-5 stars and a <strong><em>whopping 94%</em></strong> have said that a negative online review has convinced them to not patronize a business.</p>
<p><strong><u>You know you&rsquo;re really a 5 star business and your customers love you but...</u></strong> it&rsquo;s becoming clear that Google Reviews can be a make or break situation for local businesses if those happy customers never leave a review!</p>
<p>Fortunately, it&rsquo;s possible to take control and have a thriving business with a 4+ Google star rating if you have the right strategy and systems.</p>
<h2 class="text-center">Imagine how much more business you&rsquo;d get if your business had a 4+ star Google Rating</h1>
<p>What if you had a review system that <em>automatically harvested positive Google Reviews from your happy customers</em>?</p>
<p>Imagine if this system also automatically sent negative reviews <strong><u>directly to management instead of Google or Yelp</u></strong> so you can fix the situation in a private setting instead a public one?</p>
<p>Imagine having all of this work on autopilot, steadily building your Google rating back to 4+ stars <em>even while you&rsquo;re sleeping or vacationing</em>.</p>
<p>What's that? You don&rsquo;t know how to setup some <strong>crazy, complex system</strong> like that? Well, what if you could have a pro hold your hand and walk you through it step by step?</p>
